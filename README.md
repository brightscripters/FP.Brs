# FP.Brs
Functional Programming with BrightScript
Collection of First-Order functions for BrightScript

## Usage
Add this BrightAuthor plugin to a project to make functions available to other plugins.
This plugin is not intended to handle events nor generate events, but rather as a library of functions.
With BrightScript global scope, adding this plugin to a project is effectively an "include".
Down the road we'll look for an elegant way to include functions as Library brs file instead of a plugin, which handles events by definition.

For syntax see examples in FpUnitTest()


## Objectives - All functions are
* Single argument
* Immutable
* Composeable
